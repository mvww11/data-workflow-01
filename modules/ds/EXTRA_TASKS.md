## Instructions

You only need to implement one of these tasks!

## Tasks

* Add a new function to the `data_science` package to fetch the data from the sales table.
* Create a new model class using a machine learning model of your choice!
* Modify the current model's `save` and `load` functions to save the model with a dynamic name based on the timestamp, and then load the latest model by default.
